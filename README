NAME
    vcardtidy - normalize the format of VCARD files

VERSION
    1.0.2 (2022-10-10)

SYNOPSIS
      usage: vcardtidy [FILES...] [OPTIONS...]

        Synopsis:
          tidy (normalize) VCARD contact files

        Arguments:
          FILES         Str   file to tidy (default is stdin)

        Options:
          --filter,  -f PERL  Perl filter(s) to run against $_ first
          --help,    -h       print a Help message and exit
          --no-rev,  -R       do not update REV value
          --version, -V       print version information and exit

DESCRIPTION
    vcardtidy formats VCARD files, using Text::vCard::Addressbook to
    normalize field order and capitalization.

    By default vcardtidy acts like a filter, reading from "stdin" and
    writing to "stdout".

    Any "FILES..." provided as arguments are tidied up in place without
    backup! Users are encouraged to use a revision control system (e.g.
    Git) or have secure backups.

OPTIONS
    --filter, -f PERL
        Before tidying, evaluate the "PERL" string with $_ set to the
        input text. The modified $_ value then input to
        Text::vCard::Addressbook for tidying.

        Tools like sed(1), awk(1) and of course perl(1) are obviously
        natively designed to modify text, in a better way. But
        "--filter" ensures that you still have a valid VCARD afterwards,
        allowing you to easily iterate while you develop your change.

        To add an additional or missing category for example:

                $ vcardtidy \
               -f '$_ .= "\nCATEGORIES:\n" unless m/^CATEGORIES:/m' \
               -f 's/^(CATEGORIES:\S+)(\s+)$/$1,$2/m' \
               -f 's/^(CATEGORIES:.*)(\s+)$/${1}NewCat$2/m'

    --help, -h
        Print the full usage message and exit.

    --no-rev, -R
        By default vcardtidy sets a new "REV" timestamp. Use this flag
        to prevent that.

    --version, -V
        Print the version and exit.
