    vcardtidy - normalize the format of VCARD files

VERSION
    1.0.1_1 (yyyy-mm-dd)

SYNOPSIS
      usage: vcardtidy [FILES...] [OPTIONS...]

        Arguments:
          FILES           Str  file to tidy (default is stdin)

        Options:
          --help,      -h      print a full help message and exit
          --no-update, -U      do not update REV value
          --version,   -V      print version information and exit

DESCRIPTION
    vcardtidy formats VCARD files, using Text::vCard::Addressbook to
    normalize field order and capitalization.

    By default vcardtidy acts like a filter, reading from "stdin" and
    writing to "stdout". Any file names given as arguments will be
    tidied up in place.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --help, -h
        Print the full usage message and exit.

    --no-update, -U
        By default vcardtidy sets a new "REV" timestamp. Use this flag
        to prevent that.

    --version, -V
        Print the version and exit.
