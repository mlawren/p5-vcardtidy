NAME
    vcardtidy - normalize the format of VCARD files

VERSION
    1.0.1_1 (yyyy-mm-dd)

SYNOPSIS
      usage: vcardtidy [FILES...] [OPTIONS...]

        Synopsis:
          tidy (normalize) VCARD contact files

        Arguments:
          FILES         Str   file to tidy (default is stdin)

        Options:
          --filter,  -f PERL  Perl filter(s) to run against $_ first
          --help,    -h       print a Help message and exit
          --no-rev,  -R       do not update REV value
          --version, -V       print version information and exit

DESCRIPTION
    vcardtidy formats VCARD files, using Text::vCard::Addressbook to
    normalize field order and capitalization.

    By default vcardtidy acts like a filter, reading from "stdin" and
    writing to "stdout". Any file names given as arguments will be
    tidied up in place.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
    --filter, -f PERL
        Before tidying, evaluate the "PERL" string with $_ set to the
        input text. Can be used multiple times.

        You can easily achieve the same effect with tools like sed(1),
        awk(1) or even perl(1) itself. But "--filter" ensures that you
        still have a valid VCARD afterwards, allowing you to easily
        iterate while you develop your change.

        To add a VCARD category for example:

                $ vcardtidy \
               -f '$_ .= "\nCATEGORIES:\n" unless m/^CATEGORIES:/m' \
               -f 's/^(CATEGORIES:\S+)(\s+)$/$1,$2/m' \
               -f 's/^(CATEGORIES:.*)(\s+)$/$1,NewCat$2/m'

    --help, -h
        Print the full usage message and exit.

    --no-rev, -R
        By default vcardtidy sets a new "REV" timestamp. Use this flag
        to prevent that.

    --version, -V
        Print the version and exit.
